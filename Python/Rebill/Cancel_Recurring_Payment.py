##
# BluePay Python Sample code.
#
# This code sample runs a $0.00 Credit Card Auth transaction
# against a customer using test payment information, sets up
# a rebilling cycle, and also shows how to cancel that rebilling cycle.
# See comments below on the details of the initial setup of the
# rebilling cycle.
