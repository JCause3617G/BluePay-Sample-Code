# BluePay Python Sample code.

# This code sample runs a Credit Card sales transaction, 
# including sample Level 2 and 3 processing information,
# against a customer using test payment information.
# If using TEST mode, odd dollar amounts will return
# an approval and even dollar amounts will return a decline.
