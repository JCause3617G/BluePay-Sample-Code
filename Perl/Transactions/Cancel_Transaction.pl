# BluePay Perl Sample code.

# This code sample runs a $3.00 Credit Card Sale transaction
# against a customer using test payment information.
# If approved, a 2nd transaction is run to cancel this transaction.
# If using TEST mode, odd dollar amounts will return
# an approval and even dollar amounts will return a decline.
